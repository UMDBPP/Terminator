This directory is meant for developing the barebones components necessary to build a STM32 project from scratch. The two tutorials below have some good info. At some point I'd like to do this, but for now I can just copy a project generated by the STM32 Cube IDE and build it myself, which is easier since it generates all of the necessar boilerplate for me.
